.The Importance of the Later Addition of Baptism and Death Dates
****
[NOTE]
====
The later additions to this marriage record (in this case) of the individual's baptism and death dates
provides extra confirmation of precisely who they were: when they were born and baptized, in the case of an added baptism
date, and when they actyually died, in the case of a death date that was later added. With these later
added dates, we evidence created by someone--the pastor or sexton--who personally knew them. One doesn't
have to rely solely on using their name or their residence in one record in order to identify them in
other records. This is especially important because in social and religous milieu of the time there was
much variety in given names, and children were apparently named often after a grandfather or grandmother
or a baptism sponsor. The same names repeat over and over. Furthermore the village and house number may
not belong to a single family--not if more than one family lived at that address.

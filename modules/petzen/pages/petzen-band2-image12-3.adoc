.The Importance of the Later Addition of Baptism and Death Dates
****
[NOTE]
====
The later additions to the marriage (in this case) record of the individual's baptism and death dates
provides extra confirmation of who they were in the past (in the case of the baptism date) and who they later
are (in the case of the death date). With this extra date information, one doesn't have to rely solely on
usin their name or their residence or other attributes when we try to identify their birth, confirmation or death
date. It provides extra evidence of their identity beyond merely their name or residence. This is especially
helpful in an era when the same limited set of given names appear so frequently and used over and over again,
and at a time whenn several families may have lived at the same address.

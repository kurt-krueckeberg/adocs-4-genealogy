* Abbreviations seem to have been used for the first names of the parents, likely to save space
since they had so many. 
* I don't know what the symbols after the father's name mean. The first is a single character (sort of
a aidways loop) followed a two-character abbreviattion. It might refer to his wife
since it is immediately followed by `geb.` `geb.` is almost certainly an abbreviation for `geboren` (born),
referring to the maiden name of the wife (the surname she was born with). There may be a legend of some
sort at the start of the volume that explains this mysterious abbreviation/symbols.

The page heading is:

`32.) Taufen. (Baptism)          1837`

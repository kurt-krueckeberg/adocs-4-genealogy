[NOTE]
.Some comments
====
Key Points:

* Abbreviations have been used for the first names of the parents, likely to save space
since they had so many. 
* I don't know what the symbols after the father's name mean. The first is a single character that
looks like a sort of sideways loop). It is followed a two-character abbreviattion. This seems to
refer to the wife since it is immediately followed by `geb.`  (geboren) referring to the maiden name
of the wife.  There may be a legend at the start of the volume?

The Carl Friedrich Krückeberg family arrived in Castle Garden, New York City, on 19 November 1850, on the ship Hermine
that departed from the port of Bremen. The parents and the three oldest children are listed together; however, the three
youngest children--Wilhelmine Christine (born 1843), Friederick Wilhelm (born 1846) and Ernst Wilhelm Heinrich (born 1850)
--appear on the penultimage page of the passenger list.

= Naturalization and the Purchase of Federal Land

== Naturalization Process in mid 19^th^ Centruy

Under U.S. naturalization laws in the mid-19th century, an alien typically
had to reside in the United States for at least *two years* before they
could file a *Declaration of Intention* to become a citizen. This waiting
period allowed the government to ensure that the individual was genuinely
committed to residing in the U.S. and intended to become a citizen.

The naturalization process at the time required the following general
steps:

[arabic]
. *Residency of two years:* Before filing the Declaration of Intention,
the alien had to live in the United States for at least two years.
. *Declaration of Intention:* After the two-year residency, the alien
could go to a court and formally declare their intent to become a U.S.
citizen.
. *Five-year total residency requirement:* Before final naturalization
(when they filed their "second papers" or petition for citizenship),
they had to live in the United States for a total of five years.

However, some flexibility existed depending on state laws or policies,
and land laws often made exceptions to attract settlers, as with public
domain land sales.

== The Preemption Act of 1841

The *Preemption Act of 1841* was the federal land act that waived the two-year
residency requirement for foreign nationals before they could make their
*Declaration of Intention* to naturalize. This act allowed settlers, including
foreign-born individuals, to claim and purchase up to 160 acres of public land
at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre, provided they met certain conditions.

=== Key Provisions Relevant to Foreign Nationals:

[arabic]
. *Waiver of the Two-Year Residency Requirement:* Foreign-born
individuals were permitted to file a *Declaration of Intention to
naturalize* as part of their preemption claim. They were not required to
fulfill the two-year residency requirement beforehand, allowing them to
access land sooner.
. *Proof of Settlement and Improvement:* Preemption claimants (both
citizens and foreign nationals) had to prove they had settled on and
improved the land, such as by building a home or farming it.
. *Naturalization Intention:* Foreign-born claimants needed to declare
their intention to become U.S. citizens as part of the process. This
declaration was typically made in local or federal courts.

The *Preemption Act* was designed to encourage westward expansion and
the settlement of frontier lands, including in Indiana. By waiving
certain naturalization prerequisites, the act aimed to attract settlers,
including immigrants, to populate and develop public domain lands.

The *Land Ordinance of 1785* did not specifically address naturalization
or the residency requirements for foreign nationals seeking to purchase
federal land. It was primarily concerned with surveying, dividing, and
selling public lands in the newly acquired western territories to
generate revenue and organize settlement. The ordinance set up the grid
system for land distribution but did not include provisions related to
naturalization or residency waivers.

The *Preemption Act of 1841* was the first federal land law to
explicitly waive the two-year residency requirement for foreign
nationals who wanted to purchase federal land in the public domain. This
act allowed them to file a *Declaration of Intention to naturalize*
immediately upon claiming land under the preemption provisions. This
marked a significant policy shift to encourage immigrant settlement on
frontier lands.

== Key Distinction:

* *Land Ordinance of 1785:* Focused solely on the system of land survey
and sale, with no provisions related to naturalization or waiving
residency requirements.
* *Preemption Act of 1841:* Specifically allowed foreign nationals to
purchase public land after filing their Declaration of Intention,
waiving the two-year residency requirement to facilitate settlement.

Thus, it was not until the *Preemption Act of 1841* that the two-year
residency requirement for filing a Declaration of Intention to
naturalize was waived in the context of federal land purchases.

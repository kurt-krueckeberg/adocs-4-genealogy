= Understanding Nachträge

In German paleography and archival practice, there is a general term for later-added notes to an ortiginal record
of a ceremont: they are called "Nachträge" (singular: Nachtrag), which translates to "addenda" or "later additions."

In the context of Kirchenbücher (church books), a Nachtrag might include:

* A death date added to a baptism or marriage entry (often prefaced with “†” or “gest.” for gestorben)

* A confirmation date added to a baptism record

* A marriage note added to a baptism record

* a baptism date and, when the individual dies, a death date

* An emigration note, especially in 19th-century records

Notes about illegitimacy, legitimization, name changes, etc.

These entries were often added by the same or a later pastor, typically in smaller or different handwriting, as you noted.

Related terms:

* Randvermerk – marginal note (if the note appears in the margin, which is common)

* Vermerk – annotation or remark

* Hinweis – indication or note (more generic)

So, if you're describing the inserted death date in genealogical notes or research, you could write:

....
"Der Todestag wurde später als Nachtrag in kleinerer Schrift hinzugefügt, mit dem Vermerk 'gest.'."
("The death date was later added as an addendum in smaller handwriting, with the note 'gest.'.")
....

== Their Significance

The later additions or Nachträge inserted in smaller handwriting to an original record of a church
ceremony provide extra confirmation of precisely who an individual is: it tells us, say, when they
were born and baptized, or when they were confirmed, married or died. One doesn't have to infer such
dates carefully by looking for their name in vast number of recorded ceremonies. One is freed from
relying on and comparing other identifying attributes of the individual, like their residence or their
parent's name. Instead the pastor (or perhaps church sexton) who personally knew the individual supplies
this infornation free of charge as it were. 

This is especially important because in social and religous milieu of the time there wasn't
much variety in first names. Cchildren were apparently named often after a father, mother, grandfather
or grandmother or a baptism sponsor. One sees the same given names repeated over and over. If the surname
is very prvelant in a church parish, the Nachträge-supplied dates allow us to immediately confirm
earlier or later ceremonies and the information contained in them.

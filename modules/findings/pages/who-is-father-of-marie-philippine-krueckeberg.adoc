another Johann Heinrich Krückeberg who was still alive?

Ernest Thode's German-English Genealogical Dictionary translates "Leibzüchter" as "person on life estate":

* A Leibzüchter is an aging or retired farmer who has transferred the farm (typically to a child or heir) but
retains the right to live on the farm and receive support (often food, clothing, firewood, care) for the rest
of his life.

* It was not a tenancy in the modern sense (i.e., renting from someone else), but rather a post-retirement life arrangement.

The record does not state the father is deceased:

* "Leibzüchter" implies a current, active status: The term describes someone currently receiving the benefits of a life estate.
If the individual were deceased, they would no longer be a "person on life estate."

* He is not described as "des verstorbenen(late/deceased) Vaters Johann Heinrich Krückeberg" unlike the
groom's late father, who is "des verstorbenen Albert Raulfing n. 13 in Bärenbusch" ("of the late Albert
Raulfing [of] n. 13 in Bärenbusch"). 

Johann Heinrich Krückeberg (1767-1805) was xref:petzen:petzen-band1a-image220,adoc[born] in Berenbusch in 1767, but
he xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image243.adoc[died in 1805] at age 38 at no. 19 Evesen, which was the residence of his wife, Anna Catharine Sophia
née Krömer, prior to their xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image5-1.adoc[marriage] in 1790. 

No. 19 Evesen is where Johann Heinrich and Anna Catharine Sophia née Krömer lived when their children were born:

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image52.adoc[], who xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image230.adoc[died in 1794]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image59-60.adoc[]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image71.adoc[]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image82-1.adoc[]

According to his daughter's confirmation records, after his death in 1805 his surviving wife and three daughters continued to live at "no. 19 Evesen":

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image201.adoc[]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image207-2.adoc[]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image211-3.adoc[]

The two oldest daughter's married before 1827, the last year of the "Verzeichnis der Getauften, Konfirmierten, Getrauten und Gestorbenen 1785-1827"
that records their parent's marriage and their births, baptisms, confirmations and marriages. The 2^nd^ oldest daughter, Christine Louise,
xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[married December 1, 1816]. Philippine Louise Eleonore, the oldest daughter, married at age 29, on
xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[May 12, 1822]. 

Both of their marriage records note that their father is deceased and that his address while he was alive is still their address:

[quote, "Name, Religion Geburts u. Wohnort der Braut" for Christine Louise]
____
Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs, des verstorbeneen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen hinterlassene eheliche Tochter.
Luth. Conf. u. jetzt 19. Jahr alt
geb. 26.4.1798
gest. 11.9.1878
____

[quote, "Name, Religion, Birthplace and Residence of Bride)" for Christine Louise]
____
Maiden Christine Louise Krückeberg, the surviving daughter of the late Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen
Luth. Conf. and now 19 years old
born 4/26/1798
died 9/11/1878
____

This grammatical breakdown explains how the German is rephrased in English:

. Main subject: 

+
*"Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs"* +
→ “Maiden(Virgin) Christine Louise Krückebergs”
+
* The *-s* on Krückebergs is not possessive, but likely a *dialectal/feminine marker*.
. Appositive genitive(possesive) phrase:

+
*"des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen hinterlassene eheliche Tochter"* +
→ “legitimate surviving daughter of the deceased Johann Heinrich Krückeberg of No. 19 in Evesen”

This *entire genitive phrase* modifies and explains *who Christine Louise is* — she is the *daughter* of this man.

The bride's "Geburts u. Wohnort" (birthplace and residence) is given in terms of her late father's address.

While *"n. 19 in Evesen"* is grammatically modifying the *father*,
because it appears under the column for *"Geburts und Wohnort der Braut"* (birthplace and residence of the
bride), and no other residence is given, it is certainly meant to indicate that Christine Louise currently
lives at No. 19 in Evesen, even if described indirectly through her father's former home.

This style is used repeatedly in the later Petzen marriage records: individuals are identified
by their household and using the father’s name and house number to define the residence.

The "Name, Religion Geburts u. Wohnort der Braut" for Philippine Louise" for Philippine Louise is identical:

[quote, "Name, Religion Geburts u. Wohnort der Braut" for Philippine Louise]
____
Jungfrau Philippine Louise Eleonore Kruckebergs, eheliche Tochter des verstorbenen Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen
Luth. Conf. U. jetzt 29 Jhr alt
____

[quote, "Name, Religion, Birthplace and Residence of Bride" for Philippine Louise]
____
Maiden Philippine Louise Eleonore Kruckebergs, legitimate daughter of the late Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen
Luth. Conf. and now 29 years old
____

Contrast this with the xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[marriage record] for Marie Philippine Krückeberg. In the column
for the groom labeled "Name, Stand, Religion und Eltern des Bräutigams" ("Name, status, religion, and parents of the groom"), it
reads:

[quote, "Name, Stand, Religion und Eltern des Bräutigams"] 
____
Junggeselle Friedrich Wilhelm Raulfing, des verstorbenen Albert Raulfing n. 13 in Bärenbusch hinlerlaßener Sohn und Anerbe Luth. Conf.
und jetzt 23 Jahre alt
geb. 13.7.88 gestr. 5.12.59
____

Rephrased in English:

[quote, "Name, Status, Religion and Parents des Bräutigams"] 
____
Bachelor Friedrich Wilhelm Raulfing, son of the late Albert Raulfing, born in Bärenbusch, sole heir, Lutheran.
and now 23 years old.
Born July 13, 1888, died December 5, 1959.
____

The fasct that Friedrich Wilhelm Raulfing's father is deceased is clearly noted.


The father of Marie Philippine Krückeberg was still alive and lived at *no. 10 Bärenbusch* as a pensioner (*Leibzüchter*).
By the time Marie Philippine Krückeberg married in December of 1812, the Johann Heinrich Krückeberg who was born in 1767 and lived at 
no. 19 Evesen had been dead for seven and a half years. Furthermore his xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image243.adoc[death record] lists
the *Hinterbliebenen* (surviving relatives) as "eine Witwe und *3 Kinder*" ("a widow and three children"). His widow was Anna Catharine
Sophia, and as shown his three daughters were

* Philippina Eleonora,
* Christine Louise and
* Sophie Caroline.

If Marie Philippine Krückeberg were his daughter, he would have been survived by "4 Kinder" not "3".

==== The Nachträge Breadcrumbs Trail

The most recent Nachtrag that appears for a Krückeberg in "Verzeichnis der Getauften, Konfirmierten,
Getrauten und Gestorbenen 1785-1827" is the December 1, 1816, the xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[marriage

The column "Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat" (Name, religion, birth, and residence of the bride) reads:

[quote, Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat] 
____
"des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen hinterlassene eheliche Tochter. 
Luth. Conf. u. jetzt 19. Jahr alt." 
____

[quote, Name, Religion, Birth and Place of Residence of the Bride]
____
Maiden Christine Louise Krückeberg, the legitimate surviving daughter of the late Johann Heinrich Krückeberg,i
[of] No. 19 in Evesen. Lutheran confession and now 19 years old.
____

Grammatical breakdown:

* *Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs* +
→ “Maiden” (unmarried woman) Christine Louise Krückeberg — the -s on Krückebergs is genitive,
indicating possession (i.e., "of Christine Louise Krückeberg").

* *des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen* +
→ "of the deceased Johann Heinrich Krückeberg, No. 19 in Evesen"
This *entire phrase modifies* "Tochter" (daughter), describing the father — his name and the house
where he lived (and where the daughter presumably still resides).

* *hinterlassene eheliche Tochter*
→ "surviving legitimate daughter"
This shows she was born in lawful wedlock (ehelich) and outlived her father (hinterlassen).

* *Luth. Conf*. = *Lutherische Konfession* (Lutheran confession/faith)

* *jetzt 19. Jahr alt* = "now 19 years old

While the phrase *"n. 19 in Evesen"* grammatically refers to the father,
because it appears under the column for *"Wohnort der Brat"* (residence of the
bride), and no other residence is given, it is certainly meant to indicate that
Christine Louise currently lives at No. 19 in Evesen, even if described
indirectly through her father's former home.

This the style used in the Petzen records seems to be: identifying individuals
their household and using the father’s name and house number to define the
residence. 

At some point, Christine Louise Krückeberg's December 1, 1816, marriage record
was supplemented with her birth date and after her death with her death date. 

This birth Nachtrage (addendum) states, Christine Louise's birth occurred
xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image71.adoc[on April 26, 1798]. Her her birth record,
too, was later supplemented with the correct future marriage date of December
1, 1816. The marriage and birth records are agree with each other.

Her birth-and-baptism record also gives her family's residence as "no. 19
Evesen". From the birth record we have these family group details:

Her xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image207-2.adoc[confirmation record] is found around the expected date of April 7, 1811,
when she was three and a half weeks shy of 13 years old. Her identity is confirmed by matching the information 
given for her parent's names, her birthdate and the families current residence with the same information
in her marriage record.

Her mother's given name's differ slightly between these two records: "Anne Sophie Kromer" vs "Kathar[ine] Sophie Krömer".
The xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image5-1.adoc[marriage record] of her parent's resolves this discrepancy. TODO explain that
marriage record has all her given names. But put the explanation after adding children below.

TODO: 
The confirmation records also provide the identity of both parents of a child.

TODO:
Now, add these prospective daughters in the marriage records listed below:

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[1812 Marie Philippine Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[1822 Philippine Louise Eleonore Krückeberg Marriage]

Theses recods should have the bride's 1.) father's name and his address, which is also her address since bride's
lived at home until marriage. We can use the bride's age founnd in the marriage record to determine her approximate
birth year, and so locate her birth record. Her birth-baptism records will contain both parent's
names and the family's residence. We will the be able to confirm that the father listed in the marriage record
and living at the address given in the marriage record of his daughter, father his daughter by the
mother listed both on the birth record. 

NOTE: 
TODO:
Prospective birth-baptism records:
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image59-60.adoc[1793 Philippina Eleonora Kruckebergen Baptism]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image71.adoc[1798 Christine Louise Krückeberg Baptism]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image82-1.adoc[1803 Sophie Caroline Krückeberg Birth]
did some daughters marry outside the Petzen congregation.

TODO:
To identify the father's, Johann Heinrich's death rtecord, simply state: "I went through all the death records backward from
when he was last mentioned alive (which is likely in one of his children's marriaghe records)...

TODO:
Prospective child, though mother's given  name is "off".

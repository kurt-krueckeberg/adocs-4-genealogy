== TODO Later: For Their Descendents and Them

We need on-site Bückeburg archives research done.

Put togehter the further reaseach needed. Be sure I have a complete list of individuals.:
Determine the recorded events needed--marriage, confirmation, baptism--and its Nachträge
for these individuals: 

== Outline of Analysis

TODO: Move this after what I already wrote below under "Johann Heinrich Family Group, No. 19 Evesen"
In the years three daughters of Johann Heinrich Krückeberg or Heinrich (in one case) married in the years:

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[1822 name here]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 name here]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[1812 ]

The residence is no. 19 Evesen in each case?. In the marriage of daughter xxx, there is an addenda that gives her birthday and death date. The birth record likewise contains an addendaqH6 that gives the data for marriage. These two records  cross refences to the other.  The the information in common between the records is consistent. todo: list it.The baptism record has includes  the identity of the mother.

In the other records we can use the age given to determine the approximate birth year and examine the birth records to see if they too reveal the name of the mother.

Todo:Write that analysis up here.

Mention we have the negative evidence that there are no other records and since we have conscientiously searched all records involving the surname k r u e c k e b e r g we can rule out that there were no other children baptized in the p e t z e n Church for this couple.

Mention the steinbergen birth and the fact that it has no birth record in the Steinbergen  church.

== Write up a explanation and the significance of the Nachträge.

Then move this to the introduction to the church records.

==== The Nachträge Breadcrumbs Trail

The most recent Nachtrag that appears for a Krückeberg in "Verzeichnis der Getauften, Konfirmierten,
Getrauten und Gestorbenen 1785-1827" is the December 1, 1816, the xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[marriage
record for Christine Louise Krückeberg].

The column "Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat" (Name, religion, birth, and residence of the bride) reads:

[quote, Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat] 
____
"des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen hinterlassene eheliche Tochter. 
Luth. Conf. u. jetzt 19. Jahr alt." 
____

[quote, Name, Religion, Birth and Place of Residence of the Bride]
____
Maiden Christine Louise Krückeberg, the legitimate surviving daughter of the late Johann Heinrich Krückeberg,
[of] No. 19 in Evesen. Lutheran confession and now 19 years old.
____

Grammatical breakdown:

* *Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs* +
→ “Maiden” (unmarried woman) Christine Louise Krückeberg — the -s on Krückebergs is genitive,
indicating possession (i.e., "of Christine Louise Krückeberg").

* *des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen* +
→ "of the deceased Johann Heinrich Krückeberg, No. 19 in Evesen"
This *entire phrase modifies* "Tochter" (daughter), describing the father — his name and the house
where he lived (and where the daughter presumably still resides).

* *hinterlassene eheliche Tochter*
→ "surviving legitimate daughter"
This shows she was born in lawful wedlock (ehelich) and outlived her father (hinterlassen).

* *Luth. Conf*. = *Lutherische Konfession* (Lutheran confession/faith)

* *jetzt 19. Jahr alt* = "now 19 years old

While the phrase *"n. 19 in Evesen"* grammatically refers to the father,
because it appears under the column for *"Wohnort der Brat"* (residence of the
bride), and no other residence is given, it is certainly meant to indicate that
Christine Louise currently lives at No. 19 in Evesen, even if described
indirectly through her father's former home.

This is style used in the Petzen marriage records: identifying individuals
by their household and using the father’s name and house number to define the
residence.

*geb. = née* 

geb. -- quote ?Thode's dictionary. Translated *née*. Née is a French word meaning born.
When placed after a woman's name it indicates her family name of birth.

At some point, Christine Louise Krückeberg's December 1, 1816, marriage record
was supplemented with her birth date and after her death with her death date. 

This birth Nachtrage (addendum) states, Christine Louise's birth occurred
xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image71.adoc[on April 26, 1798]. Her her birth record,
too, was later supplemented with the correct future marriage date of December
1, 1816. The marriage and birth records are agree with each other.

Her birth-and-baptism record also gives her family's residence as "no. 19
Evesen". From the birth record we have these family group details:

Her xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image207-2.adoc[confirmation record] is found around the expected date of April 7, 1811,
when she was three and a half weeks shy of 13 years old. Her identity is confirmed by matching the information 
given for her parent's names, her birthdate and the families current residence with the same information
in her marriage record.

Her mother's given name's differ slightly between these two records: "Anne Sophie Kromer" vs "Kathar[ine] Sophie Krömer".
The xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image5-1.adoc[marriage record] of her parent's resolves this discrepancy. TODO explain that
marriage record has all her given names. But put the explanation after adding children below.

TODO: rererad the Shannon Grren article on identity. Use the "negative" evidence that all the Krückeberg records in the
Petzen 1795-1827 Kirchenbuch have been identified and put on ndocs.krueceberg. What is negative evidence?
**Negative Evidence**

**Definition:** Negative evidence arises when the absence of a record where one would be expected becomes evidence
in itself.

In my case:

I've thoroughly examined the entire Kirchenbuch for all occurrences of the surname Krückeberg between 1795 and 1827.

If no additional daughters of Johann Heinrich Krückeberg appear in the records where you would reasonably expect
them—such as in baptisms, confirmations, or marriages—then their absence is informative.

This absence becomes negative evidence that there were no other daughters born or raised in the parish during that time period.

Note: Negative evidence is not the same as a lack of evidence. It's not simply “nothing was found,” but rather “nothing was
found where something would be expected." If there where further daughters, then there would be a baptism-birth record.

One daughter was born in Steinbergen.

Outlineto use after concluding this section that starrted with the Nachtrage for the daughter:
. next to the marriage of Johann Heinrich and his wife
. then the birth of their children--not born 9in Steinbergen
. then their confirmations
. then their marriages, using yje outline at top of this page.

sum up: these are all children born/baptized in Petzen.


Heinrich of No. 19 Evesen is the father in a marriage record, and we have found not just marriage, birth and confirmation
(and  death) records involving his name, but all Krückebergs.

TODO: 
The confirmation records also provide the identity of both parents of a child.

TODO:
Now, add these prospective daughters in the marriage records listed below:

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[1812 Marie Philippine Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[1822 Philippine Louise Eleonore Krückeberg Marriage]

Theses recods should have the bride's 1.) father's name and his address, which is also her address since bride's
lived at home until marriage. We can use the bride's age founnd in the marriage record to determine her approximate
birth year, and so locate her birth record. Her birth-baptism records will contain both parent's
names and the family's residence. We will the be able to confirm that the father listed in the marriage record
and living at the address given in the marriage record of his daughter, father his daughter by the
mother listed both on the birth record. 

NOTE: 
TODO:
Prospective birth-baptism records:
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image59-60.adoc[1793 Philippina Eleonora Kruckebergen Baptism]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image71.adoc[1798 Christine Louise Krückeberg Baptism]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image82-1.adoc[1803 Sophie Caroline Krückeberg Birth]
did some daughters marry outside the Petzen congregation.

TODO:
To identify the father's, Johann Heinrich's death rtecord, simply state: "I went through all the death records backward from
when he was last mentioned alive (which is likely in one of his children's marriaghe records)...

TODO:
Prospective child, though mother's given  name is "off".

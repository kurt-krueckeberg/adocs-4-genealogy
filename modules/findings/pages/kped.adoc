== TODO Later: For Their Descendents and Them

We need on-site Bückeburg archives research done.

Put togehter the further reaseach needed. Be sure I have a complete list of individuals.:
Determine the recorded events needed--marriage, confirmation, baptism--and its Nachträge
for these individuals: 

== Outline of Analysis

TODO: Move this after what I already wrote below under "Johann Heinrich Family Group, No. 19 Evesen"
In the years three daughters of Johann Heinrich Krückeberg or Heinrich (in one case) married in the years:

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[1822 name here]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 name here]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[1812 ]

The residence is no. 19 Evesen in each case?. In the marriage of daughter xxx, there is an addenda that gives her
birthday and death date. The birth record likewise contains an addendaqH6 that gives the data for marriage. These two
records  cross refences to the other.  The the information in common between the records is consistent. todo: list
it.The baptism record has includes  the identity of the mother.

In the other records we can use the age given to determine the approximate birth year and examine the birth records to
see if they too reveal the name of the mother.

Todo:Write that analysis up here.

TODO: Mention we have the negative evidence that there are no other records and since we have conscientiously searched all
records involving the surname Krückeberg we can rule out that there were no other children baptized in the Petzen
church for this couple.

Mention the steinbergen birth and the fact that it has no birth record in the Steinbergen  church.

== Write up a explanation and the significance of the Nachträge.

Then move this to the introduction to the church records.

==== The Nachträge Breadcrumbs Trail

Some church records contain addenda (Nachtrage in German) that reference other church records for the same individual.
The the example below is an excerpt from a marriage record, whose first two column describe the groom and bride. Each
ends with the date of baptism, *get.*, short for *getauft*, baptized; followed by the date of death/burial, *gest.*,
short for gestorben, died.

image::nachtrag_example.jpg[link=self]

These addendum (Nachträge) identity the same individual in the records they cross reference. One does not
have to infer the individuals identity. The Nachtrag confirms it for you.

The most recent Nachtrag that appears for a Krückeberg in "Verzeichnis der Getauften, Konfirmierten,
Getrauten und Gestorbenen 1785-1827" is the December 1, 1816, the xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[marriage
record for Christine Louise Krückeberg].  At some point, Christine Louise Krückeberg's December 1, 1816, marriage record
was supplemented with her birth-and-baptism date and after her death with her death date. 

Here is her family information from the column *"Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat"* (Name, Religion, Birth and Place of
Residence of the Bride):

[quote, "Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat"] 
____
Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs, des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen
hinterlassene eheliche Tochter. Luth. Conf. u. jetzt 19. Jahr alt. 
____

[quote, English rephrasing]
____
Christine Louise Krückeberg, an unmarried woman, [is] the legitimate surviving daughter of the late Johann
Heinrich Krückeberg of No. 19 in Evesen.
____

This grammatical breakdown explains the English rephrasing:

. Main subject:
*"Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs"* +
→ “Maiden Christine Louise Krückebergs”
+
* The *-s* on Krückebergs is not pssessive, but likely a *dialectal/feminine marker*.
. Appositive genitive(possesive) phrase:
*"des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen hinterlassene eheliche Tochter"* +
→ “legitimate surviving daughter of the deceased Johann Heinrich Krückeberg of No. 19 in Evesen”

This *entire genitive phrase* modifies and explains *who Christine Louise is* — she is the *daughter* of this man.

Notice also that the bride's address is given in terms of her late father's address.

While the phrase *"n. 19 in Evesen"* grammatically refers to the father,
because it appears under the column for *"Wohnort der Brat"* (residence of the
bride), and no other residence is given, it is certainly meant to indicate that
Christine Louise currently lives at No. 19 in Evesen, even if described
indirectly through her father's former home.

This is the style used in the Petzen marriage records: identifying individuals
by their household and using the father’s name and house number to define the
residence. 

This table summarizes the family information in her marriage record:

As mentioned, Christine Louise Krückeberg's December 1, 1816, marriage record
was later supplemented with her birth date and after her death with her death date. 

The birth Nachtrage (addendum) gives Christine Louise's birth/baptism date as
xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image71.adoc[on April 26, 1798]. Only one *Christine Louise
Kückeberg* was baptized on that date. Her birth record, too, was later supplemented
with the then-future marriage date of December 1, 1816. The Nachträge confirm these
marriage and birth records refer to the same person.

Her birth-and-baptism record also gives her family's residence as "no. 19
Evesen". Since it provide's her mother's namem, we now have these family group details:

A xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image207-2.adoc[confirmation record] Christine Louise is found
around the expected date of April 7, 1811, when she was three and a half weeks shy of 13
years old. Her identity is confirmed by matching the information given for her parent's names,
her birthdate and the families current residence with the same information in her marriage
record.

Her mother's given name's differ slightly between these two records: "Anne Sophie Kromer" vs "Kathar[ine] Sophie Krömer".
The xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image5-1.adoc[marriage record] of her parent's resolves this discrepancy. TODO explain that
marriage record has all her given names. But put the explanation after adding children below.

TODO: rererad the Shannon Grren article on identity. Use the "negative" evidence that all the Krückeberg records in the
Petzen 1795-1827 Kirchenbuch have been identified and put on ndocs.krueceberg. What is negative evidence?
**Negative Evidence**

**Definition:** Negative evidence arises when the absence of a record where one would be expected becomes evidence
in itself.

In my case:

I've thoroughly examined the entire Kirchenbuch for all occurrences of the surname Krückeberg between 1795 and 1827.

If no additional daughters of Johann Heinrich Krückeberg appear in the records where you would reasonably expect
them—such as in baptisms, confirmations, or marriages—then their absence is informative.

This absence becomes negative evidence that there were no other daughters born or raised in the parish during that time period.

Note: Negative evidence is not the same as a lack of evidence. It's not simply “nothing was found,” but rather “nothing was
found where something would be expected." If there where further daughters, then there would be a baptism-birth record.

One daughter was born in Steinbergen.

Outlineto use after concluding this section that starrted with the Nachtrage for the daughter:
. next to the marriage of Johann Heinrich and his wife
. then the birth of their children--not born 9in Steinbergen
. then their confirmations
. then their marriages, using yje outline at top of this page.

sum up: these are all children born/baptized in Petzen.


Heinrich of No. 19 Evesen is the father in a marriage record, and we have found not just marriage, birth and confirmation
(and  death) records involving his name, but all Krückebergs.

TODO: 
The confirmation records also provide the identity of both parents of a child.

TODO:
Now, add these prospective daughters in the marriage records listed below:

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[1812 Marie Philippine Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[1822 Philippine Louise Eleonore Krückeberg Marriage]

Theses recods should have the bride's 1.) father's name and his address, which is also her address since bride's
lived at home until marriage. We can use the bride's age founnd in the marriage record to determine her approximate
birth year, and so locate her birth record. Her birth-baptism records will contain both parent's
names and the family's residence. We will the be able to confirm that the father listed in the marriage record
and living at the address given in the marriage record of his daughter, father his daughter by the
mother listed both on the birth record. 

NOTE: 
TODO:
Prospective birth-baptism records:
* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image59-60.adoc[1793 Philippina Eleonora Kruckebergen Baptism]

* xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image82-1.adoc[1803 Sophie Caroline Krückeberg Birth]
did some daughters marry outside the Petzen congregation.

TODO:
To identify the father's, Johann Heinrich's death rtecord, simply state: "I went through all the death records backward from
when he was last mentioned alive (which is likely in one of his children's marriaghe records)...

TODO:

The **Indiana Land Office Records** link will show results for:

* the local land offices in **Fort Wayne** and **Indianapolis**.
* Swamplands records.

The sale of tracts of land in **Adams county** were handled by the Fort Wayne land office, which was merged (around 1850?) with the
Indianapolis office. I believe its records were merge with the Indianapolis office.

livestock owned by farmer (broken down by breed) Amount of agricultural goods
produced during the preceding year (broken down by crop) Cash value of the
farm, farming machinery, livestock, animals slaughtered during the past year,
and "homemade manufactures" The 1880 schedules provide additional details, such
as the amount of acreage used for each kind of crop, the number of poultry, and

example, small farms that produced less than $100 worth of products annually
were not included. By 1870, farms of less than three acres or farms that
produced less than $500 worth of products were not included.

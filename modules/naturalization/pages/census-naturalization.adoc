= Censuses and Naturalization

Since several censuses contain questions relating to naturalization, they can
be used to add details about an ancestor's naturlization. For example, in 1900,
we can learn whether an ancestor was still **Al**, an Alien; whether he had
filed his  **PA**, his Declaration of Intent (first papers); or whether he was
**Na**, naturalized?

**Pa** (**Papers filed**), or **Na** (**Naturalized**).

|1910|Continued to ask about father's and mother's country of birth, **year of immigration and naturalization status using the same coding
system as 1900**. Also asked about the mother tongue.

|1920|Added questions about naturalization year, providing more precise data on when naturalization
occurred.

|1930|Similar to previous censuses, it asked about year of immigration and naturalization status.
Asked for the language spoken at home before coming to the U.S.

|1940|Asked year of immigration and naturalization status.

on specialized surveys like the American Community Survey (ACS).

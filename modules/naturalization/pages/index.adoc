= Naturalization

== Overview of the Naturalization Process

The **Naturalization Act of 1802** required prospective citizens to be "free
white persons" with good moral character, reside in the United States for five
years, declare their intention to become citizens at least three years in
advance, and renounce their allegiance to any foreign country, essentially
meaning they had to show a commitment to becoming a US citizen and demonstrate
good character. 

Key points about the 1802 Act:

* Residency requirement: Five years 
* Declaration of intent: Required to be made at least three years before applying for citizenship by
filing the Petition to Naturalize. 
* Eligibility restriction: Only "free white persons" could apply 
* Moral character requirement: Applicants needed to demonstrate good moral character

There were three major exceptions to the five-year requirement. Val Greenwood
in The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy, 4th Edition", pages 561-562,
explains:

[quote, "The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy, 4th Edition", pages 561-562]
____
* The **first exception** was called **"derivative" citizenship** and was applied to
wives and minor children of men who became naturalized citizens. Between 1790
and 1922, of a naturalized man automatically became a citizen, did an alien
woman who married a US citizen.... 
+
Between 1790 and 1940, children under 21 became naturalized citizens when
their fathers were naturalized. However, prior to September 1, 1906, information
about these wives and children was rarely included in the papers.

* The **second exception**, this one applying between 1824 and 1906, was that
**minor aliens who had resided in the United States for at least 5 years before
turning 23** could file both their declaration and petition at the same time. 

* The **third exception** was applicable to aliens who were in the US military
who were **U.S. military veterans**. An 1862 law allow an **army veteran of
any War who was honorably discharged and who had at least one year of residency
to file his petition for naturalization without having previously filed a
declaration of intent**.

.What if the father of minor children never became a citizen?
****
If the father of minor children, those under 21, never naturalized, his minor
children, if they were born outside the U.S., would not automatically later
become citizens. This is true even if the father did file the Declaration of
Intent.

If the father filed a Declaration of Intent to naturalize, but failed to file
(three years or more years later) the Petition to Naturalize--or if he died
before he could do so--his children would still need to file a Declaration of
Intent. This could be done when they reached the age of 21 provided they had
resided in the U.S. for five years. Then, two years later they could Petition
to Naturalized.

NOTE: Prior to 1906, the naturalization process for minors reaching adulthood
differed slightly from the process for adults who began the process
independently. The minors reaching adulthood at 21 would only have to wait two
years instead of three after they filed their Declaration of Intent.

== Naturalization Occurred in the Courts

The courts were solely responsible for the entire naturalization
process:

[quote, "The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy, 4th Edition", pages 562]
____
It is important to remember that prior to 1906 the courts were responsible for
the entire process. Naturalization proceedings could take place in any US
District Court, in any court of the several States, the district or Supreme
Courts of the territories. The clerk of the court was required to record all
proceedings.
____

The Declaration of Intention could be filed in any "court of record" (municipal,
county, state, or Federal).  The subsequent Petition to Naturalzie could be filed in
a different court. The clerk of the court was required to record all proceedings.

The <<history-declaration-of-intention, “Old Law” Declarations of Intention (Jan. 29,
1795 – Sept. 26, 1906>> process and content consisted of: 
 
[quote, History of the Declaration of Intention (1795-1956)]
____
Declaration of Intention records' content and format varied between courts
before Sept. 27, 1906.

“Old Law” Declarations usually offer less biographical information than their
Standard Form successors but can contain more information about the subject
than “Old Law” Petitions for Naturalization, court orders conferring
citizenship, or Certificates of Naturalization.

Filing and recording an “Old Law” declaration was a very straightforward undertaking.
Making an “Old Law” declaration required no proof of actual eligibility for
naturalization; any alien, aged eighteen or older, could file a declaration
with any naturalization court at any time. The declarant simply paid the
prescribed fee, appeared before the court (or often the clerk), and made a
declaration of intention under oath. [xiii]

The clerk of the court created a Declaration of Intention to document the event
and entered it in the court’s permanent records. Without statutory guidance or
administrative oversight, the design and quality of “Old Law” Declarations
differed by court and each clerk filed and indexed naturalization records
according to local recordkeeping practice.

The declarant usually received a receipt (or “Certificate of Intention”)
showing that the declaration had been made. (If the declarant later applied for
citizenship, this proof of the receipt was attached the Petition for
Naturalization as proof the declaration had been made.) If a receipt was not
issued, or if it was lost, an immigrant might make a new declaration in a court
at a new location. Many immigrants made multiple declarations.

.Waiting Period before Filing the Petition to Naturalize
|===
|Declaration of Intention Filed Between|Waiting Period (years of residency required)

|January 29, 1795 and June 17, 1798|3 years
|June 18, 1798 and April 13, 1802  |5 years
|April 14, 1802 and May 25, 1824   |3 years
|May 26, 1824 and December 23, 1952|2 years
|===

NOTE: Between April 14, 1802 and May 25, 1824, there was no Declaration of Intention.

== Key Points to Remember

* Declaration of intentions could be filed at any time;
* The declaration and Petition for Naturalization could be filed in different courts,
* Many declarants filed more than one declaration, and
* Finding a declaration does not in itself mean the declarant naturalized.

.Family Search Wiki on Declaration of Intention
****
The Family Search wiki U.S. article on <<family-search, United States Naturalization and Citizenship>>
states this about the Declaration of Intention:

[quote]
____
**Declaration of Intention.** The immigrant filed a declaration of intention (also
called first papers) to renounce allegiance to foreign governments and to later
prove he or she had resided in the country long enough to apply for
citizenship. However, generally speaking, an immigrant filed a declaration of
intention up to two years after he immigrated to the United States. The
immigrant could declare any time after he arrived after fulfilling the
residency requirement. Some immigrants waited as late as 20 years after coming
to the United States to begin the process to become a citizen. There are some
exceptions to the naturalization process where the immigrant was not required
to file a declaration.
____

The article also states the 5-year residency requirement before filing the Petition to Naturalization also
include a 1-year residency in the state.

== Civil War Veterans

A law passed in 1862 allowed Army Veterans of a war could file with a Declaration of Intent
after only one year of residence in the U.S.

== Records of Naturalization

The main naturalization document are:

* **Declaration of Intention** - Prior to 1906, this gave the county of origin, applicant's +
name, date of application, applicant's signature. After 1906, much more information was given.
* **Petition to Naturalize**
* **Certificate of Citizenship** issued once citizenship was granted. The courts did +
not retain a copy.

Other documents that may also appear:

* Naturalization Deposition
* Oath of Allegiance
* Certificate of Arrival

.Categories of Naturalizatioin Records and Where they are located 
****
The excerpt below explains the difference between naturalization documents and the notes made
by court clerks in court order books about naturalization proceedings. It is from the foreword
of _An Index to Naturalization Record in pre-1907 Order Books of Indiana County Courts_:

[quote, Foreword to An Index to Naturalization Record in pre-1907 Order Books of Indiana County Courts]
____
Before the 1950s candidate could file the necessary paperwork in any court from the federal
level down to the local level. Thus, researchers looking for naturalization records must be
aware of the categories of naturalization records and where they are located. Currently in
Indiana, naturalization records fall into two categories: **naturalization proceeding notes
in court order books, which are notes abiyt court proceedings jotted don by court clerks and
which indexed in this volume;** and "naturalization documents", which are manuscript items
such as forms, certificates, and bound naturalization books, which are located at the Indiana
State Archives.

=== What the Declaration of Intent Did 

The Declaration of Intention did not make you a U.S. citizen. But declarants could be <<history-declaration-of-intention, conscripted into
the U.S. Armed Services>> and nine states even allowed declarants to vote.

== Naturalization and Immigrants who Applied for Land Patents 

Recent immigrants could apply to buy a federal land patent. They were not
required to be citizens, nor were they required to first make a Declaration of
Intention to naturalize--although the Preemption Act of 1841, which gave
"squatters" (those already living on public domain land) the first chance the
purchase the land on which they resided, did require either citizenship or
making a Declaration of Intention to naturalize.

As Allison B. Tirres writes in <<ownership-article, "Ownership Without
Citizenship: The Creation of Noncitizen Property Rights">>, page 25, it was not
until 1887 that alien purchase of pulic land was qualified:

[quote, "Ownership Without Citizenship: The Creation of Noncitizen Property Rights", page 25]
____
Not until 1887 would Congress prohibit alien purchase of public lands, and that
prohibition was significantly qualified by an exception allowing noncitizens
who had filed declarations of intent to purchase.
____

On pages 24-25, she adds:

[quote, "Ownership Without Citizenship: The Creation of Noncitizen Property Rights", page 24-25]
____
The ability of aliens to purchase federal land remained free of either
naturalization or declaration of intent requirements; as the Attorney General
wrote in an opinion regarding an 1854 land law, "But what is there in the act
to forbid the alien to purchase... in open competition with all the world, as
he may other public lands? I do not perceive anything."

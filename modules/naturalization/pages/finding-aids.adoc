=== Background History

The content _An Index to Naturalization Records In pre-1907 Order Books of
Indiana County Courts_ derives from the work of the Work Progress
Administration's Historical Records Survery, which among other things indexed
Declaration of Intentions and Petition to Naturalize found in court order
books. The article <<naturalization-article, _Naturalization_, Adams County
Trumpeter of the Adams County Historical Society, Vol. 6., No. 3, October 1988,
page 1>> explained:

[quote, Naturalization article, page 1]
____
The US Department of Justice sponsored a nationwide project from October, 1941,
to April, 1942, to locate and index these records. We are fortunate that **all
92 counties in the state of Indiana participated** in the project which was
administered by the **Division of Community Services Programs, Works Projects
Administration**. War effort superseded completion of the project nationwide.
**The completed index survey files were found in the late seventies in the
archives division of the Indiana State Library. The family history section of
the Indiana Historical Society became interested in the files and in 1981
published “An Index to Indiana naturalization records found in various order
books of the ninety-two local courts prior to 1907”**. A copy is still
available for $10 to members and $20 to non-members from the Indiana Historical
Society.

== Adams County, Circuit Court Records

.Order Book versus Civil Records
****
Order Books

* **Purpose:** Order Books are official summaries of the court's daily proceedings, including entries about cases, motions, rulings, and filings like Declarations of Intention for naturalization.
* **Content:** They often include references to case numbers, participants, dates, and the actions taken by the court. They are essential for tracking down detailed case files or related documents.

Circuit Civil Records

* **Purpose:** These are broader collections of records related to civil cases handled by the Circuit Court, including naturalization records, lawsuits, property disputes, and other non-criminal matters.
* **Content:** May include original filings, case documentation, and summaries of cases recorded in the Order Books.

How Are They Related?

* The Order Books are typically the first point of record for legal proceedings and decisions.
* The Civil Records might contain more detailed documentation about the cases or filings referenced in the Order Books.

If the library has the Circuit Civil Records, they may include the Order Books as part of the collection. Contact the library to confirm:

1. Whether the Civil Records include Order Books for the specific volume and timeframe you’re researching.
2. If the records are indexed for easy searching by name, date, or page reference.

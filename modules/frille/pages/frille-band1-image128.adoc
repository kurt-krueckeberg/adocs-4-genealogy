=== Transliteration and Translation

[NOTE]
The occupation given for the father Henrich Philipp Bleke is truncated. The remaioder
of the word "Schulm" is not visible in the digitize image. Perhaps it was too close
to center margin, which appears to have been reinforced with a material only partially
transparent. "Schulm" most likely is the word: Schulmeister (Schoolmaster).

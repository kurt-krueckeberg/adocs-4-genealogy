Conrad Buuck was apparently not before the voge to American but after in October of 1841. How could he, then, have been "three months
of age" when the family emigrated? His mother would have three month pregnant when the family departed in April and arrived in May.
If Ernst Diedrich, who spoke German, explained that his wife was "three months pregnant" upon departure, it might have been misunderstood
as "three months of age".

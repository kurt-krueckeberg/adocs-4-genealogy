Ernest Thode's German-English Genealogical Dictionary translates "Leibzüchter" as "person on life estate":

* A Leibzüchter is an aging or retired farmer who has transferred the farm (typically to a child or heir) but
retains the right to live on the farm and receive support (often food, clothing, firewood, care) for the rest
of his life.

* It was not a tenancy in the modern sense (i.e., renting from someone else), but rather a post-retirement life arrangement.

The record does not state the father is deceased:

* "Leibzüchter" implies a current, active status: The term describes someone currently receiving the benefits of a life estate.
If the individual were deceased, they would no longer be a "person on life estate."

* He is not described as "des verstorbenen(the late/deceased father) Vaters Johann Heinrich Krückeberg" unlike the
groom's late father

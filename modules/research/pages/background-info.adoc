.Adams County Trumpeter of the Adams County Historical Society, Vol. 6., No. 3, October 1988, page 1:
____
The US Department of Justice sponsored a nationwide project from October, 1941, to April, 1942, to locate and index these
records. We are fortunate that all 92 counties in the state of Indiana participated in the project which was administered by
the Division of Community Services Programs, Works Projects Administration. War effort superseded completion of the project
nationwide. The completed index survey files were found in the late seventies in the archives division of the Indiana State
Library. The family history section of the Indiana Historical Society became interested in the files and in 1981 published
“An Index to Indiana naturalization records found in various order books of the ninety-two local courts prior to 1907”. A copy is
still available for $10 to members and $20 to non-members from the Indiana Historical Society….
____

The index gives 1.) the person's name, 2.) the name of the court order book and 3.) the page number within the book.

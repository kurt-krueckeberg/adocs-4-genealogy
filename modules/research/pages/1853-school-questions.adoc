= Which Schools did Bleeke and Krückeberrg Children Attend in 1853

* **Question**: In 1853 the children of "Christian F. Bleakey" and "John H. Bleakey" attend different
schools than the children of "Charles Krickenbarger" and "Henry Krickenbargor"--but why? 
According to the 1853 Indiana School Enumeration, the Bleeke children go to school xref:bleeke:1853-school-enumeration.adoc[school No. 4]
while the children of "Charles Krickenbarger" and "Henry Krickenbargor" go to
xref:krückeberg:1853-school-enumeration.adoc[school No. 5]?
+
Was school No. 4 simply closer to the Bleekes and school No. 5 closer to the
Krückebergs?
* **Question**: Which schools were (perhaps still are)  **school No. 4** and **school No. 5**?

= Proof Argument: The Identity of Philippine Eleonore, Wife of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg

== Research Question

Was the mother of Carl Friedrich Krückeberg (b. 1807) and Caroline Dorothee
Krückeberg (b. 1812) a woman named *Philippine Eleonore Blecken*, or was this
an error in the church records, and she was in fact *Philippine Eleonore
Werkmeister*, wife of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg?

== Summary Conclusion

The typewritten Familienschein des Auswanderers (family certificate of the emigrants),
which comes down to us from Harry Frederick Krueckeberg, who believed it was typed
by his father, lists *Philippine Lenore, geb, Bleeke* as the wife of Carl
Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg. This document, even if it were the original, is
derived from the original church records. What do they reveal?

All available evidence confirms that Philippine Eleonore *Werkmeister*,
baptized on 4 May 1783 in Evesen No. 11, was the _only_ wife of Carl Friedrich
Gottlieb Krückeberg. The appearance of the surname *Blecken* in two child
baptismal records is a clerical error. There is no evidence of a second
marriage, and multiple primary sources directly contradict the “Blecken”
surname attribution.

This is a derivative summary reflecting the inconsistent primary records.

== Negative Evidence and Absence of Conflicting Facts

- No burial record exists for a first wife (Werkmeister) prior to 1807.
- No second marriage record exists for Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg.
- House number *Evesen 11* is identical in all records — unlikely if a different woman had entered the household.
- First and middle names, baptism date, and residence are all consistent across all entries — only the surname varies.

== Analysis

The 1803 marriage, the 1803 baptism of the first child, and the 1783 baptism of
Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister are internally consistent and refer to the same
individual.

The use of the surname *Blecken/Bleeken* in 1807 and 1812 appears to be a
clerical mistake, perhaps repeated due to copying or memory. Such mistakes are
not uncommon in 19th-century rural German church records.

The addendum in the 1812 baptism (“get. 4.5.83”) is especially significant: no
child with the surname Blecken was baptized on that datein Pertzen. Only *Philippine
Eleonore Werkmeister* matches.

== Conclusion

All consistent, original, and corrected records confirm that *Philippine
Eleonore Werkmeister* (baptized 4 May 1783, d. 16 December 1840) was the *only
wife* of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg.

The instances of her maiden name being listed as *Blecken* are clerical errors.
Therefore, the mother of Christine Philippine (1803), Carl Friedrich (1807),
and Caroline Dorothee (1812) was *Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister*.

== Evaluation of Alternative Hypothesis: Divorce and Remarriage to a Second "Philippine Eleonore"

An alternative hypothesis might suggest that Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg
divorced his first wife, *Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister*, and married a
second woman who coincidentally had the same given names, *Philippine
Eleonore*, but a different surname, *Blecken*. It could be further proposed
that this second marriage occurred in a different parish, which is why no
second marriage record appears in the Petzen church book.

While theoretically possible, this hypothesis is effectively disproven by the evidence:

- Divorce in early 19th-century Schaumburg-Lippe, though legally permitted in Lutheran regions, was extremely rare, required court proceedings, and was generally recorded or annotated in church registers. No such annotation or divorce record exists in this case.

- The *Nachtrag* (addendum) to the 1803 marriage record of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg and *Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister* provides both her baptism date (4 May 1783) and her death date (16 December 1840). This indicates that the original marriage remained valid throughout her life and that no second wife entered the household.

- All records that mention *Philippine Eleonore Blecken* also include the house number *Evesen No. 11* and, most notably, the exact same baptism date: *4 May 1783*. This date matches only one known individual in the parish — *Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister*.

- No baptism record exists for a *Philippine Eleonore Blecken* on or near that date. Thus, it is not possible that a second woman of that name and birthdate existed in Evesen.

- The theory would require an improbable coincidence: that two women named *Philippine Eleonore*, born on the same day, lived in the same house, and married the same man without any contemporary record of divorce or remarriage. This stretches plausibility far beyond what the evidence can support.

This alternative is therefore dismissed. The totality of the documentary evidence — including the baptism, marriage, and death records, as well as the internal consistency of place, name, and birthdate — confirms that the mother of all three children was *Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister*. The use of the surname *Blecken* in the 1807 and 1812 baptism entries must be regarded as a clerical error.

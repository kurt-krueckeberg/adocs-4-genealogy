== Research Question

Was the mother of Carl Friedrich Krückeberg (b. 1807) and Caroline Dorothee
Krückeberg (b. 1812) a woman named *Philippine Eleonore Blecken*, or was this
an error in the church records, and she was in fact *Philippine Eleonore
Werkmeister*, wife of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg?

== Summary Conclusion

All available evidence confirms that Philippine Eleonore *Werkmeister*,
baptized on 4 May 1783 in Evesen No. 11, was the _only_ wife of Carl Friedrich
Gottlieb Krückeberg. The appearance of the surname *Blecken* in two child
baptismal records is a clerical error. There is no evidence of a second
marriage, and multiple primary sources directly contradict the “Blecken”
surname attribution.

== Evidence

. *Marriage Record (13 March 1803, Petzen Parish)*  
Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg married *Jungfer Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister* of *Evesen No. 11*.  
**Nachtrag (addendum)** to this record states:
  - Baptism date: *4 May 1783*
  - Death date: *16 December 1840*

. *Baptism of First Child (7 December 1803, Petzen Parish)*  
Christine Philippine Krückeberg, daughter of Carl Friedrich and *Philippine, geb. Werkmeister*.

. *Baptism of Second Child (24 May 1807)*  
Carl Friedrich Krückeberg’s baptism lists the mother as *Philippine Lenore geb. Blecken aus N. 11 in Evesen*.

. *Baptism of Third Child (2 December 1812)*  
Caroline Dorothee Krückeberg’s baptism also lists the mother as *Philippine Leonore geb. Blecken aus N. 11 in Evesen*.  
An addendum below this entry states: *“get. 4.5.83”* (baptized 4 May 1783).

. *Baptism Record (4 May 1783, Evesen Parish)*  
*Philippina Eleonore Werkmeister*, daughter of *Tönnies Werkmeister* of *Evesen No. 11*.

. *Familienschein (Family Certificate)*  
Lists the mother as *Philippine Leonore, geb. Bleeken, von N. 11 in Evesen*.  
This is a derivative summary reflecting the inconsistent primary records.

== Negative Evidence and Absence of Conflicting Facts

- No burial record exists for a first wife (Werkmeister) prior to 1807.
- No second marriage record exists for Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg.
- House number *Evesen 11* is identical in all records — unlikely if a different woman had entered the household.
- First and middle names, baptism date, and residence are all consistent across all entries — only the surname varies.

== Analysis

The 1803 marriage, the 1803 baptism of the first child, and the 1783 baptism of
Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister are internally consistent and refer to the same
individual.

The use of the surname *Blecken/Bleeken* in 1807 and 1812 appears to be a
clerical mistake, perhaps repeated due to copying or memory. Such mistakes are
not uncommon in 19th-century rural German church records.

The addendum in the 1812 baptism (“get. 4.5.83”) is especially significant: no
child with the surname Blecken was baptized on that date. Only *Philippine
Eleonore Werkmeister* matches.

== Conclusion

All consistent, original, and corrected records confirm that *Philippine
Eleonore Werkmeister* (baptized 4 May 1783, d. 16 December 1840) was the *only
wife* of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg.

The instances of her maiden name being listed as *Blecken* are clerical errors.
Therefore, the mother of Christine Philippine (1803), Carl Friedrich (1807),
and Caroline Dorothee (1812) was *Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister*.

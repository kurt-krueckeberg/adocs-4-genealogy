= Questions to Pursue

Research questions:

* Document the precise family relationships of those Krückebergs who settled in Adams county, including any we were previously unaware of.
* Extend document further their pedigree, their line of descent.
* Discover and document further other relatives or (to a lesser extent) close friends we also immigrated to Adams county in the chain of 
migration of the Bleeke, Weiland and Krückeberg families to Adams county.
* Discover and contact any others who have research of value to us.
* Someone named **Reinhard Pankwitz** has added to the Krückeberg tree on FamilySearch. Since his addtions are without documentation supporting them, they needed to be proven true or false.

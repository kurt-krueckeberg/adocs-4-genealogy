== Get Naturlaization Records

The Adams County Trumpeter newletter/jounral of the Adams County Historical Society published, in two separate issues,one
for A-K and the second for K-Z, the article explains that:

[quote, Naturalization, Adams County Trumpeter, October 1988]
____
The US Department of Justice sponsored a nationwide project from October, 1941, to April, 1942, to locate and index these
records. We are fortunate that all 92 counties in the state of Indiana participated in the project which was administered by
the Division of Community Services Programs, Works Projects Administration. War effort superseded completion of the project
nationwide. The completed index survey files were found in the late seventies in the archives division of the Indiana State
Library. The family history section of the Indiana Historical Society became interested in the files and in 1981 published
“An Index to Indiana Naturalization Records Founded Various Order Books of the 92 Local Courts Prior to 1970” close quote a
copy is still available for $10 to members and $20 to non-members from the Indiana Historical Society….
____

The index gives 1.) the person's name, 2.) the name of the court order book and 3.) the page number within the book.

FamilySearch has digitized the link:https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/1150012[Adams' County Court Order books] and
they are availalbe to view at afflilates like the Genealogy Center, where the images can be downloaded to one's harddrive.

I would also like to read more about the history of the indexing and try to locate the original work in which it was
contained. 

What was the time wait before declaration and oath for naturalziaton in the 1850's?

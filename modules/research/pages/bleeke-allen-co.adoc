_Check out Sarah Rupp. link:https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/GCMM-S3M[https://www.familysearch.org/]_

_Sarah is a younger sister to my 2nd great-grandmother Anna Marie "Mary"_
_Rupp (the wife of our Christian Friedrich Bleeke, and daughter-in-law of_
_Johann HP Bleeke)._

_Sarah’s husband was Christian Friedrich Wilhelm "William" Bleeke / Blake_
_/ Blakey / Bleke. It’s certain the Union Township Bleekes had some_
_knowledge of the Allen County Blakes / Bleekes / Bleke._

_Most of Christian Friedrich Wilhelm's "William’s" siblings and ancestors_
_are from the village of Quetzen, and were baptized in Lahde. So it was_
_reported for Christian Carl Diederich Blake / Bleke link:https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/MVC2-TL7[https://www.familysearch.])._
_Sadly, I cannot connect these two men with each other._

= Carl Friedrich Krückeberg's Naturaltion Declaration

== Summary

In order to apply for and purchase land from the federal government, you had to either be native-born or have made your
declaration to naturalize (started the first step in the naturalization process).  See:
xref:naturalization:attachment$naturalization-lecture-handout.pdf[U.S. Naturalization: The Records, the Laws, and the
Impact].

The children of the father who immigrated automatically became U.S.  citizens when the father completed his naturalization.
They did not have to go through the naturalization process. If the father died after declaring his intention to naturalize,
but before he completed the 2nd step, the children still were automatically naturalized. The wife/mother's naturalization was
completely tied to her husband.

The timeline for Carl Friedrich Krückeberg is:

* On *19 November 1850*, he and his family <<arrival, arrived in New York City>>.
Then they had to travel to Fort Wayne (likely using the Wabash-Erie
canal system).
* On *16 December 1850*, Carl Friedrich Krückeberg went to the Fort
Wayne land office and applied and paid for a tract of federal land under
the Swaplands Act. He must therefore have *declared his intention to
naturalize* beforehand. 
* The <<obit1, News Sentinel obituary>> for his eldest son, Carl "Charles" Heinrich Wilhelm Krückeberg (1835-1915)
states:

____
He was born in German and brought by his parent to the United States...
The family lived for a time in Fort Wayne, where his father was engaged
in the tailoring business.
____

* The <<obit2, Journal Gazette obituary>> for Carl Heinrich Wilhelm Krückeberg states:
+
[quote, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, 18 December 1915, page 6]
____
When fifteen years of age, the family settling in Fort Wayne, where
the subject of this sketch was engaged in the tailoring business with
his father.
____


The family was living in Fort Wayne when Carl Friedrich applied and paid for a tract of federal land on 16 December 1850. It
is therefore likely he made his declaration of intention to naturalize in a Fort Wayne court, either at the end of November
1850 or the beginning of December 1850. He might have made the declaration to naturalize in Decatur, but I'd look first in
the court records of Allen county, which Family Search has digitized.

**Question:** You had to have made your Declaration of Intention to naturalization, if you wanted to apply for and purchase
federal land in the Public Domain states like Indidana, but if you had to wait two years to first make your Declaration of
Intention for naturaliztion, then how could someone like CFK apply and pay for federal land within 30 days of his arrival?

[IMPORTANT]
.Important Comments
====
The article "Pioneers renew acquaintances, 1895" did not mention any of our ancestors or those they knew best.
I did mentioned on German pioneer whose surname was Steele.

The article "Eagle, 1873" (which has excerpts from the Eagle from April 12, 1867 to April 11, 1873) has this comment: **Microfilm in Decatur Library**. Therefore it likely
has microfilm of other similiar early issues of the **The Eagle** newspaper.

I still have to read the article above nor the "Eagle, excerpts, 1866-67"

IMPORTANT: While the "Assessor's statement of agricultural products, 1853" applies to French township only, it
tells us that there are likely assessments from the same timeframe of Preble and Union townships available in the
Adams's County Assessor's/Auditor's Office.

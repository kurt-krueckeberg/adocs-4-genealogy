= What was Philippine Eleonore's Maiden Name?

== Why Did the Maiden Name of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg's Wife Change?

=== Reasearch Question

**Why is there a discrepency in the maiden name of "Philippine Lenore" in  the baptism records of
two of her three chilren?**. 

=== Background

Two of the children of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg (18 April 1779 - 13 May 1838) were
Carl Friedrich and Caroline Dorothee. The name of the children's mother recorded in their 
baptism records was **"Philippine Lenore geb. Blecken aus N. 11 in Evesen"**; however,
the name of the wife whom Carl Friedrichrich Krückeberg married on March 13, 1803 
had a different surname. The xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image12-3.adoc[March 13, 1803, marriage record]
for Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg lists his Braut (bride) as: **"Jgfr
Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister"**, whose Ort(place) and number are **Evesen 11**.

Did the pastor or sexton "confuse" the mother's maiden name in 1807, when
son Carl Friedrich was born, and then again in 1812, when his sister, Caroline Dorothee,
was born, making the same "mistake" twice? This was a parish in an agrarian, rural society, 
and church records were legally mandated documents. 

Did Carl Friedrich Gottlieb remarry to someone also named *"Philippine Eleonore (Lenore)"*,
which was a common name?

When Caroline Dorothee Krückeberg, the daughter of Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg
and Philippine Eleonore was xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image125-entry31.adoc[baptized on December 2, 1812],
her mother's name is recorded as:  **"Philippine Leonore geb. Blecken aus N. 11 in Evesen"**.
There is also an addenda written in a smaller hand beneath the text that gives the "Name,
Religion u. Geburtsort der Mutter (birthplace of the mother)". It says:
xref:petzen:petzen-band1a-image287.adoc["get. 4.5.83"]. She was "getauft" (baptized) on May 4, 1783.

Furthermore, the xref:families:krueckeberg.adoc[Familienschein (family certificate)]
for the Carl Friedrich Kruecberg family states his mother was: **"Philippine
Leonore, geb. Bleeken, von N. 11 in Evesen"**. However, this merely a derived document based
on the original church records. 

Looking at the xref:petzen:petzen-band1a-image287.adoc[baptism recorded on May 4, 1783], it is for an
infant named **Philippina Eleonore Wekmeister**, whose father is **"Tönnies (diminutive for Anton)
Werkmeister aus Evesen no. 11"**.

Compare this surname with the surname found in the xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image12-3.adoc[March 13, 1803,
marriage record] for Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg, where the name of his Braut (bride) is: **"Jgfr
Philippine Eleonore Werkmeister"**, whose Ort and number are: **Evesen 11**. "Philippine Eleonore
Werkmeister" was only 19 when she married, so she had not previously been married.

Why would Caroline Dorothee Krückeberg's mother's maiden name be given as "Blecken" when she was
born? And why would the xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image96.adoc[May 24, 1807, birth/baptism record of her brother,
Carl Friedrich Krückeberg], also have this same discrepancy, listing his mother as: **"Philippine
Lenore geb. Blecken aus n. 11 in Evesen"**?
=== Research Plan 

*Philippine Eleonore(Lenore)* was a common given name. It alone is not sufficent for confirming an
individual's identity. We need to find the records for:

* the birth/baptiwsm records for all her children. The xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image96.adoc[birth record
for Carl Friedrich] states he is the *2^nd^* child and *1^st^* son. The xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image125-entry31[birth
record for Caroline Dorothee] states she is the *3^rd^* child and *2^nd^* daughter.

* Find the confirmation and death records for Philippine Eleonore nee Werkmeister
Krückeberg. Her death date is found in the Nachtrag attached to her marriage 
record. Her confirmation year can be calculated as approximately birth year 
plus 14.

* Look for Frille marriage records between 1804 and 12807.

* Find the death records for her.

* Find the death records of her husband, Carl Friedrich Gottlieb Krückeberg

* Post this issue on Archion.de forum.

=== Ongoing Research Results so far

* The couple's 1^st^ child was Christine Philippine xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image82-2.adoc[born Dec, 7, 1803]. Her
mother's name is recorded as *Philipp:geb:Werkmeister*. 
+
*Note:* Surprisingly, there are no Werkmeister sponsors! The sponsors are *Fr Kruckeberg u. Weiland aus Berenb:*.
+
At that time, they are living in Evesen, but by May 21, 1807, when Carl Friedrich Gottlieb is born, they are living
at no. 14 Berenbusch.

* Ater a cursory search, I could't find a confirmation record for *Philippine  Eleonorer Werkmeister* in the years 1799.
Needs further effort.


//More than one family might reside at an address. In 1821, for example, Johann
//Heinrich Krückeberg dies. He resides at No. 10 Berenbusch. In 1822, Jobst
//Heinrich dies. He lives at No. 10 Berenbusch.

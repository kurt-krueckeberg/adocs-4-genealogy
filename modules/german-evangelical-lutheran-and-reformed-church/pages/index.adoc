== Discovery of Bleekes Cincinnati Church

Two pieces of information link the Johann Heinrich Philip Bleeke family that settled in Adams County to the name of their church
in Cincinnati Ohio. First, the name of their pastor in Cincinnati is mentioned in the Immaunel Lutheran, Decatur, Indiana,
xref:churches:immanuel/jhp-bleeke.adoc[biography] of Johann Heinrich Philip Bleeke, who was one of its founders. This pastor was
Möllmann, and he appears in a article on the Hamilton County, Ohio, Genealogical Society's website entitled

.Möllmann pastor of  North German Lutheran Church in Cincinnati
[quote, Robert C. Rau, Genealogy of Some German Evangelical Churches in Cincinnati, Ohio]
____
in 1837, after a heated vote, **Wilhehn Moellmann**, from Osnabrück, was elected to fill the preacher's office. He
immediately discovered the great difficulties in the congregation, and wanted to resign. However, in the year 1838 a
solution was finally achieved. After several meetings it was decided to separate into two different congregations, with
the one group now being the South Germans, who would keep the old church building, and the other group being the North
Germans, who would receive a sum of money. Pastor Moellmann went with the North Germans, and this group, the third
German congregation in Cincinnati, took the name **North German Lutheran Church.** As early as 1839-40 they erected a
church on Walnut Street between 8th and 9th Streets. The South German group, who now called F. M. Raschig as pastor,
took the name **German Protestant St. John's Church**.

The aforementioned xref:churches:immanuel/jhp-bleeke.adoc[biography] of Johann Heinrich Philip Bleeke mentions the
names of two pastors in Cincinnati, Möllmann and Lauer:

* his son Carl Fridrich Wilhelm, born 30 November 1825, was: "confirmiert um Ostern 1840 on Past. Möllmann in
Cincinati[sic] (confirmed at Easter 1840 by pastor Möllmann in Cincinnati". 
* his daughter Emilie, born on 11 March 1837 was: "Getauft von Past. Lauer. (baptized by pastor Lauer)".

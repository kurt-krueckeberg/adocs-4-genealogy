An explanation of the certificate or **final certificate** is found on page 113 of <<book-cit, **Land & Property Research in the United States**>> by E. Wade Home:

[quote, page 113 of 1997 edition of "Land & Property Research in the United States"]
____
This certificate was proof of paten approval, and served as evidence that all of the
previously required steps had been fulfilled. IT was imilar to a coupon, redeemable
for the patent, which could only be given out by the General Land Office. These
**patents** were of often send to the local land office, where the patentees could
more easily exchnage their final certificates and take the precaution of registering
the certificates with the local courthouse for legal rederence and protection.

written.

= Records Besides German Church Records

Here are some types of historical records you might find for Schaumburg-Lippe in the 1700s:

1. Tax and Property Records (Steuerlisten, Grundbücher)
These may include lists of landowners, tenants, and their obligations.

They can show who lived where, and sometimes give family relationships or changes of ownership that imply inheritance.

Look for manorial records if your ancestors were on estates.

2. Citizen Rolls (Bürgerbücher)
Towns sometimes kept lists of citizens (Bürger), especially if your ancestor lived in a town like Bückeburg or Stadthagen.

These might include occupation, date of citizenship, and family status.

3. Court and Legal Records (Gerichtsakten)
Local and regional courts kept records of disputes, inheritance matters, and contracts.

Probate cases and guardianship matters can reveal family relationships.

4. Military Records
Even small principalities like Schaumburg-Lippe had military obligations. Some records exist of those who served in local militias or princely guards.

5. Census-like Documents
Full censuses were rare, but there were population lists or headcounts for tax or conscription purposes.

6. School Records
If your ancestor lived near a church school or in a town, school attendance records may exist, especially later in the 18th century.
